## Project Description

We saw the opportunity to create a Sports Team Manager application for sporting teams. Each team has a login to access information on their players (including name, goals scored, fouls recieved etc). Teams can log in add, update or delete player information when required. Admin users have privillaged access to add and delete teams in the league.

## Links

Have a look at our live page at [live page](https://sports-team-manager.herokuapp.com/) And here you can find the code for this project: [GitHub](https://github.com/Elibrer/sports-team-manager)

## Login

Detailed here is the login information for the pre-seeded users/teams within the database, as well as the `admin` account to add new users, or update/delete existing users.

>Email: `admin@admin.com`
Password: `admin12345`

>Email: `randwick@stm.com`
Password: `randwick123`

>Email: `miranda@stm.com`

>Email: `macpark@stm.com`

Click logout to end the user session.
