# Sports Team Manager

## Project Description

We saw the opportunity to create a Sports Team Manager application for sporting teams. Each team has a login to access information on their players (including name, goals scored, fouls recieved etc). Teams can log in add, update or delete player information when required. Admin users have privillaged access to add and delete teams in the league.


## Links

Have a look at our live page at [live page](ADD-HEROKU-LINK) And here you can find the code for this project: [GitHub](https://github.com/Elibrer/sports-team-manager)

## Usage

Open the page and you can find the login page. Each team has their own unique email and password. Once logged in key player data can be viewed on the screen.
Click logout to end the user session.

Select the add and delete buttons to add new players or remove current ones. Click on the view button to see player details and update player information. Upon login admin users also have access to the above data in addition to adding and deleting teams.
